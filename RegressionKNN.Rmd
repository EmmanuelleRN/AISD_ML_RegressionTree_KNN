# Machine Learning - Concepts

- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data without being explicit programmed, reason why we say that the algorithms learn.
- With ML algorithms we can build a model to make predictions or decisions.
- Machine learning algorithms are used many different applications, for example:
  - Medicine
  - Email filtering
  - Speech recognition
  - Computer vision

# Supervised Learning

.pull-left[
**Supervised learning** is where you have input variables ($X$) and an output variable ($y$) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.

<center> y = f(X) </center>

- It is the most common type of Machine Learning problem

- It is called **supervised** because we have the label that tell us the correct information, and we are going to be corrected if we predict wrong.

- Supervised learning can be grouped into two problems:
  - **Regression:** The output variable is a real number, for example, weight
  - **Classification:** The output variable is a category, for example, disease and no disease

# Classification

# Classification

**Classification** is a type of **supervised** learning where we categorise data into classes. There are many different algorithms that can help us solve this kind of problems.

Classification requires a training dataset with many examples of inputs and outputs from which to learn. It can be categorised in two types of problems:
  - **Binary classification:** The outcome has only **two** labels, for example, disease and not disease. 
    - Some popular algorithms are: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
  - **Multi-label classification:** The outcome has multiple labels, for example, dog, cat, bird and other.
    - Some popular algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes

To evaluate the model performance we can make use of ROC, confusion matrix, etc. We need to be aware of **class imbalance** problems.

# Decision Tree (CART)

---

# Decision Tree

There are various algorithms that can grow a tree. 
- Differences: 
  - Possible structure of the tree (e.g. number of splits per node)
  - Criteria how to find the splits
  - Criteria to stop splitting 
  - How to estimate the simple models within the leaf nodes. 
  
The **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)** algorithm is probably the most popular algorithm for tree induction. 
  - We will focus on CART, but the interpretation is similar for most other tree types.
  
> Note: Decision Trees can be used for both Regression and Classification problems
